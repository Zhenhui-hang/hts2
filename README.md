# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 局域网访问说明

本应用支持在局域网内访问，方便在不同设备上使用和测试。

### 启动应用

1. 确保您已安装所有依赖：
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. 启动开发服务器：
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   应用会自动在`0.0.0.0:3000`上启动，支持局域网访问。

### 访问方式

- 本地访问：打开 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- 局域网访问：在同一局域网的其他设备上，打开 `http://<本机IP>:3000`
  - 在命令行中使用 `ipconfig`（Windows）或 `ifconfig`（Mac/Linux）查看本机IP
  - 确保防火墙允许3000端口的访问

### 注意事项

1. 确保开发机器和访问设备在同一局域网内
2. 如遇到访问问题，请检查：
   - 防火墙设置
   - 端口占用情况
   - 网络连接状态

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
